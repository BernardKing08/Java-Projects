# Reverse Array

## Task Description

Write a method called `reverse()` with an `int` array as a parameter.

- The method should not return any value. It is allowed to modify the array parameter.

To reverse the array, you need to swap the elements so that the first element is swapped with the last element, the second element with the second last, and so on.

### Example

If the array is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, then the reversed array should be `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`.

### Steps

1. Print the array before reversing it:
   - `Array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
2. Reverse the array by swapping the elements.
3. Print the array after reversing it:
   - `Reversed array = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`

## Tips

- When swapping the elements, use a temporary variable to hold the current element.

## Notes

- The method should be defined as `private static`.
- Do not add a `main` method to the solution code.
- Classes that are not in the `java.lang` package should be manually imported.
