# Print Square Star

## Task

Write a method named `printSquareStar` with one parameter of type `int` named `number`.

- If the number is less than 5, the method should print "Invalid Value".
- If the number is greater than or equal to 5, the method should print a square star pattern of size `number x number`.

The pattern to print consists of stars (`*`) and spaces (` `), following these rules:
- The outer border of the square should be filled with stars.
- The diagonals of the square should be filled with stars.

## Example Input/Output

- `printSquareStar(5);` should print:


- `printSquareStar(8);` should print:


## Note

- The method `printSquareStar` should be defined as `public static` like we have been doing so far in the course.
- Do not add a `main` method to the solution code.
