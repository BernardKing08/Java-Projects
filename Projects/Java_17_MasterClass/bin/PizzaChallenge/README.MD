Congratulations, you've got a job at Python Pizza. Your first job is to build an automatic pizza order program. Based on a user's order, work out their final bill.

Small Pizza: $15  ```

Medium Pizza: $20

Large Pizza: $25

If they want to add pepperoni :

Pepperoni for Small Pizza: +$2

Pepperoni for Medium or Large Pizza: +$3

If they want cheese :

Extra cheese for any size pizza: + $1

Instructions
Open a new file in your Python development environment or IDE.
Begin by typing the line 'Welcome to Python Pizza Deliveries' which will display a welcome message when the code is run.
Add a line that prompts the user for the size of the pizza they want using the input() function and stores the user's input in a variable named 'size'.
Add a line that prompts the user if they want pepperoni on their pizza using the input() function and stores the user's input in a variable named 'add_pepperoni'.
Add a line that prompts the user if they want extra cheese on their pizza using the input() function and stores the user's input in a variable named 'extra_cheese'.
Check your code for any syntax errors or mistakes.
Run the code and test it by providing inputs for size, pepperoni, and extra cheese.
Example Input

size = "L"

add_pepperoni = "Y"

extra_cheese = "N"

Example Output

Your final bill is: $28.

When you hit run, this is what should happen
