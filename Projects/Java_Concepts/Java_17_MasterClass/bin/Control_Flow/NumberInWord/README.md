## Number In Word

Write a method called `printNumberInWord`. The method has one parameter `number` which is a whole number. The method needs to print "ZERO", "ONE", "TWO", ..., "NINE", "OTHER" if the `int` parameter `number` is 0, 1, 2, ..., 9, or "OTHER" for any other number including negative numbers. You can use if-else statement or switch statement, whichever is easier for you.

### Note

- Method `printNumberInWord` needs to be `public static` for now, as we are only using static methods.
- Do not add a main method to the solution code.
