On making the register/signup page 
it is possible to - instead of creating html and mapping it using thymeleaf, to instead 
just pass a parameter login/$signup=true, doing this upon doing this   
use thymeleaf to make the login section conditional if login/{whatevevr} == false show login
else go to signin if true  

i know it dosent make sense, i dont even understand what i wrote
